Conclusions</A>
</H3>
It had been hoped to look at lengths of runs of technical downtime to determine if there were any patterns - e.g. do these occur in runs and what is the length distribution and frequency of these. Contamination of the data from weather downtime stats and the relatively small amount of data available makes this problematic. Heuristically however we might expect this to be the case - a problem arises sporadically one night, maybe occurs the following night and spawns attempts by support staff to solve by software or engineering means. This may occur quickly or take several nights to correct, thereafter the problem disappears or becomes less frequent.

<P>
The diverse nature of these problems suggests that there is little chance of predicting future occurances - by their very nature they are unpredictable - the best that can realistically be achieved is to use the long term probabilities to estimate the likelihood of technical downtime over extended periods. 

<P>
Disruption to power supplies are sometimes known in advance and could be factored into the scheduler. Periods of planned maintainance are often known well in advance and could also be factored in - infact both these are implicitly taken account of by the operations team when setting up the content of the phase2 ODB but this information is not currently known explicitly by the scheduler - this will become more important when users are able to update their own phase2 information.

<P>
Any more comments here...
