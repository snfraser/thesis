what plots do I want?

for the night need:
 - contention plots (under UPAX conditions) real contention is somewhere inside the envelope.
 - load plots
 - demand plots

for the user solution:
 - plot v time of each metric (ie for each selected group)
 - plot v time of score generated for groups - several scoring weights (a.fx+b.fht+c.fp) etc
 - mis-selections - where do these occur ?

for the sim solutions:

what sims do I do ?

 - BDS using several scoring metrics - will give a tally score for each run (get av,std,max,min)

what metrics do I want to measure ?
