This simulation performs a very basic test of the simulation paradigm using the following models:-

EXM - basic 
SXM - basic
ENV - basic fixed (per sim run)
SCO - variable from config

SEL - basic rank #1

SQM- optimal height metric / window centring metric/ etc from config

Aim is to test the effect of varying scoring weights on the various SQMs. 

The basic variable is the scoring model weights, 
these are to be varied by the sim controller in a configurable way. 

May need to do some wort of normalization of weights ? - e.g. sum weights = 1

The simulation to be run many times for statistical results. 

Environment to be varied between different blocks of runs to give range of values,
maybe classify results by env state. 

The SQM is the optimal height and optimal time in monitor window metric. Maybe others as required. 
Load/demand PCMs to be worked out in advance of run to add to graphs.
