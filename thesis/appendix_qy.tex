\section{Calculation of $Q_Y$}
\label{sect:app_calcqy}

Define expected yield $y(g,t)$ for group $g$ at time $t$ as the number of potential executions upto $t$. $H(g,t)$ is the execution history for $g$ upto $t$ - i.e. the actual number of executions upto $t$. 

\subsection{Minimum interval timing constraint}
This is the hardest to work out. Basically due to the unspecifiness of the group's windows of opportunity all that can be done is to calculate the length of the group's target visibility per night and divide by the minimum interval.
