\subsection{Disruptive Events}
Disruptors are events which cause periods of otherwise schedulable (night) observing time to be lost.
They can be classified into 2 basic subclasses:-
\begin{itemize}
\item Predictable disruptors including; periods taken up by calibration, planned real-time and manual observing, pre-assigned fixed timing constraint scheduled observations, etc.
\item Unpredictable disruptors include; bad weather, technical downtime due to mechanical, software, electrical, network, target of opportunity (TO) observations - whether instigated by observers or automated agents etc.
\end{itemize}
