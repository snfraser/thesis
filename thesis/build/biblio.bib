                  overall control structure. The difference lies in
                  how a choice is made at each decision point. HBSS
                  uses a given search heuristic to focus its
                  exploration. The degree of focusing is determined by
                  a chosen {\em bias function} that reflects the
                  confidence one has in the heuristic's accuracy. This
                  methodology can be directly applied in a {GRASP}

                  purposeful activities that ensure long-term science
                  and engineering goals are achieved and ensure that
                  it maintains positive resource margins. This
                  requires planning in advance to avoid a series of
                  shortsighted decisions that can lead to
                  failure. However, it must also respond in a timely
                  fashion to a somewhat dynamic and unpredictable
                  environment. Thus, spacecraft plans must often be
                  modified due to fortuitous events such as early
                  completion of observations and setbacks such as
                  failure to acquire a guidestar for a science
                  observation. This paper describes the use of
                  iterative repair to support continuous modification
                  and updating of a current working plan in light of
                  changing operating context.},
