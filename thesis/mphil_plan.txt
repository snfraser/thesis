title:
Adaptive Optimal Scheduling for Robotic Telescope Operations.

aims:

1. To develop a scheduler for selection of observations for robotic telescope operations which generates the most "valuable" schedules.

plan:

1. develop metric(s) for comparing schedules from different schedulers and/or scheduling policies.

2. develop a simulation framework for testing schedulers (as plugin modules).

3. develop 2 different schedulers to test with the simulation framework.

4. collect data to characterize the telescope's operating environment.

5. test a despatch scheduler (S1) using the framework by varying the weighting and bias functions to determine the optimal settings. 
   -these may be dependant on characteristics of the operating environment and so determination of this dependancy would lead to the ability to automatically adapt the policy.

6. test a look-ahead scheduler (S2) using the framework by varying horizon and bias functions to determine the optimal settings. 

7. compare S1 and S2 on the same datasets to determine whether S2 provides any advantage.

Copy from my own abstract - this summarizes the above quite well and in better style !
