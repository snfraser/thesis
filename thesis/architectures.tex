A number of search techniques have been investigated in this field, ranging from mathematical optimization/ constraint satisfaction methods such as Linear and (Mixed) Integer Programming (LP, IP, MIP) (REFS), local search techniques (Greedy search/hill climbing)(REF), local search with noise (simulated annealing (REF), adaptive noise (REF)) problem-specific (and generic) heuristic methods (MTS, RBDS)(REF), AMP (REF) techniques such as (TABU (REF), scatter search (REF) , A*(REF), LRTA*(REF)), HBSS(REF), SWO(REF).
