\section{Investigation into effect of reliability of stability prediction}
\label{sect:exp_reliability}

\subsection{Introduction} 
As has already been seen in Sect.~\ref{sect:exp_stability}, the choice of length of look-ahead horizon is dependant on the stability of environmental conditions. This experiment is designed to examine what happens if the actual stability is better or worse than that predicted. In such cases the chosen horizon length will be an under-estimate or over-estimate. If $H$ is an under-estimate then we are wasting some of the potential advantage to be had from a long period of stability. If $H$ turns out to be an over-estimate then we might find that the sequence is cut short and we lose some of the groups which had been lined up.

\subsection{Experimental setup}
A simulation was setup using a Phase 2 model containing 500 flexible groups with feasibility windows with lengths from 30 to 120 minutes spread throughout a single night. The model was seeded with 50 groups with scores varying strongly with time over very short (15 minute) feasibility windows. These groups could easily be missed by a despatcher and were intended to boost the performance of look-ahead. A fixed execution timing model was chosen to minimize extraneous random variations.

Using a set of 8 reliability factors $q$ chosen from the range 0.1 to 2.0, and 5 look-ahead horizons $H$ chosen from the range 0.5 to 6 hours the stability parameter of the environmental model was selected as $\tau_E=H/q$. Where $q<1.0$ this represents an under-estimate while $q>1.0$ represents an over-estimate of environmental stability. For each combination of $H$ and $q$, 100 simulations were performed with different environmental scenarios generated by the environment model over the selected night and value of $Q_{SU}$ measured. A seperate set of simulations were performed with $\tau_E$ set equal to the value of $H$ and are used as a baseline.

\subsection{Results}
The results of these simulations are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:reliable}. The quantity plotted against the y-axis is the ratio $Q_{SU}/Q_0$, with $Q_0$ being the baseline value of $Q_{SU}$ with $\tau_E=H$. The error bars represent variation due to different environmental scenarios on each run. The graphs show a peak value in each case with $q$ around the value of 0.5 to 0.8. Runs with horizon of 0.5 hours show the least variation and no peak. Other horizons show a rapid rise to the peak value then a more gradual fall-off, levelling of to around 0.9 to 0.95 of the baseline value. It is notable that the peak values occur when $q < 1$ which is most likely a feature of the environmental scenario models, the mean and median of the stable period distribution are not equal, with the median being less than $\tau_E$.

\subsection{Summary and conclusions}
The effects resulting from the accuracy with which we are able to predict the environmental stability timescale was investigated. It was found that when determining the horizon length $H$, if we either over or under-estimate the duration $\tau_E$ of stable conditions we get poorer results. The optimum situation appears to be when $H \simeq f \times \tau_E$ where $f$ is around 0.7 to 0.8.
