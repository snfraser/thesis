short discussion on bidding models.

Use bidding to make the dispatcher selection. something like:

timeslot available (dispatching point)
 know environment
 know weather
 maybe predict

ask each feasible group to bid (probably ask proposal delegates to bid for group)
winner takes slot

how do we allocate funds for PDAs ?
 make something up using allocation in each of these cats
 - total hours
 - hours in bd/pax (different alloc for each e.g BP = 100u/hr, DX = 300u/hr etc

bidding fund made up by adding these with some science priority factor (proposal priority)

PDA uses something like - I will bid:

w1*airmass/optimal + w2*(env.seeing-group.seeing) + w3*(lunar - group.lunar) + w4*group.priority etc
need some sort of cutoff (max bid or max bids per night/week etc or for each group)

eventually let users define $w_i$ values as preferences - i.e. bidding agent configuration.

Advantage - user has some control over bidding so feels they control scheduling - if it fails its because 
they haven't set their preferences (weights, cutoffs etc) high enough.

Later might want to do ``look-ahead'' by allowing to bid for future slots on assumed env/weather at the time.
