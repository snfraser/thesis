\section{Conclusions}
Critical assessment of own work. State hypothesis, and demonstrate precision, thoroughness, contribution, and comparison with closest rival.

What was found out about the things in the plan. How is this going to help improve the scheduling and how will the knowledge be fed back into the loop.

\section{Further work}
These are areas to look at:-

\begin{itemize}
\item All the adaptable features of a LAS need looking at - so far we have just been working on simulations but for an operational system these need tying down and made more efficient.
\begin{itemize}
\item Adaptable horizon determinant.
\item Search mechanism - use MinEnergy, Genetic etc.
\item Sequestration policy.
\item Breakage rule and/or penalties.
\item Use of EFR and how to apply.
\end{itemize}
\item Investigation into texture metrics - these might be used to guide/adapt search.
\item AOB
\end{itemize}
