\section{Man against machine}
\label{sect:mam_study}
\subsection{Introduction}Selecting appropriate groups to perform is a complex task. There are many trade-offs to be made between the various competing preferences and constraints. When the schedule is heavily loaded, i.e. there are potentially more observations to perform than could be accomodated even under ideal conditions, the job of the scheduler becomes both simpler and more difficult. It is relatively \emph{easy} to find a solution which satisfies the constraints, however finding an optimal solution is rendered more \emph{difficult} due to the number of potential solutions to compare. 

A major problem is to determine just what those trade-offs are. We would like to be able to answer questions like:- \emph{how much more important is a high priority, non-urgent group relative to a medium priority, urgent group?} It is because it is difficult to quantify these relative weights that we turn to the human scheduler. Humans are capable of processing this type of complex, interlinked information and making these sort of trade-offs on a daily basis - often with little knowledge they are doing it. If we set up a human to perform the task we might be able to deduce from what they have done and the choices they have made some of the rules they are using (often without realizing) and the relative weightings they employ. 

Two sets of trials are performed. Firstly the human scheduler (referred to as HS) is presented with a snapshot of the ODB content for the trial night in a tabular format from which to generate a schedule. Secondly a set of simulations are run in which the relative scoring weights are changed to try and reproduce the results of HS and, \emph{if possible}, to beat them.

\subsection{Characterization of problem}
On the night of the test (13-14 November 2007) there are some 13.33 hours of night (including twilight time) with additonal details in Table.~\ref{tab:mam_nights}.
The supplied ODB snapshot consists of 131 groups and a total of 2880.32 minutes (48 hours) of available observing time in the night, an oversubscription factor of 3.6

The groups within the snapshot are distributed throughout the range of priority as shown in Table~\ref{tab:priority_distrib}. Excluding the background groups, which should only run as a last resort and do not contribute to the science program, there are a total of 34.8 hours giving a more realistic oversubscription factor of 2.6.

Figures~\ref{fig:mam_h1_contention} and \ref{fig:mam_h1_dmd} show respectively the contention and demand plots for the night. The predicted contention $C_c$ is very high at around 90 for much of the night. A simulation run with a \emph{typical} scheduler, shown on the same plot shows the actual contention dropping from around 80 to 40 over the course of the night. The total demand $C_d$ remains fairly constant at a level of around 4 to 5 for the night while the urgency-weighted demand $C_{ud}$ rises from 1 to nearly 2 over the course of the night. This latter indicates that selection of just the urgent groups would likely fill most of the available observing time.

\subsection{Human scheduling trial (HS1)}
A human subject (expert scheduler) is provided with information concerning which groups are potentially feasible on the test night. An example section of the data provided is shown in Table.~\ref{tab:example_gen}. The information, described in Table.~\ref{tab:hsgexample} contains details of the target, timing and observing constraints along with a simple pre-calculated feasibility plot for the night for each group. Some metrics are also available. The urgency metric indicates on how many remaining nights the group might be observed. The execution-time metric indicates the expected execution time of the group. 

In light of the difficulty for a human to generate the schedule by collating the considerable amount of information available a number of the normal constraints were relaxed. e.g. it is not easy for a human to keep precise track of the accumulating time to the second so execution times are given to the nearest minute. The accuracy of the availability plot is also shown only to around 5-10 minutes so when testing the feasibility (in terms of target elevation) a few degrees of leeway are given. In order to uncomplicate the scenario the assumption is also made that seeing is good for the whole night. 

The HS uses the information to devise a schedule for the night by recording the start time and ID of each group to execute in order. Due to the time taken to perform one of these HS trials - several hours, only a single trial (HS1) was performed.

\caption[Description of the columns in the table provided to the human scheduler]
{Description of the columns in the table provided to the human scheduler. In the observing constraint (OC) columns, the absence of a label means \emph{no constraint}. The timing constraints include FLEX (flexible - one off), MONITOR (monitor with period and window size (hrs)), INTVL (minimum-interval with interval size(hrs)). If the group \emph{must} be observed tonight (urgency = 1 night) this is shown as either CRIT or ICRIT (minimum-interval groups are never \emph{entirely} critical as they do not also specify a maximum interval). The availability column shows when a group is feasible through the night. Each symbol represents 1/14th part of the night and indicates depending on the symbol what fraction of that period the group can be observed. - (none of period), 9 ($<90$\% of period), * ($<100$\%) }.

\subsection{Results of HS1 trial}
The analysis proceeds as follows:- For each scheduled (group ID, start-time) pair, the feasibility is worked out for that time. This consists of testing the target elevation against dome limit (20 degs) and the group constraints on moon and sun elevation against actual elevations. If the schedule is feasible, the various quality metrics are then computed.

The HS1 experiment yielded a run of 147 group executions. There were a total of 9 overruns of respectively (1,1,1,1,3,4,5,10,10) minutes, these were considered sufficiently minor to be ignored. A preliminary look at the scoring profile shows the value of $elevation/transit\_height$ to be generally high - suggesting the human scheduler has tried to observe targets as they cross the zenith. There are 2 instances of targets observed below the horizon - one of these at -60 degrees elevation ! - possibly a misreading of a declination? This value was removed from the final results to avoid skewing.

\subsection{Simulation trials}
Several simulation trials were performed using a basic despatch scheduler (BDS) and several configurations of a look-ahead scheduler (QLAS). The BDS simulations were performed using different weighted scoring functions. The QLAS simulations were performed using horizons of 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours and using search parameters of 100, 250 and 2500 trials. Each simulation was run 100 times to obtain statistical values for the various Q metrics.

A first set of trials were run using the scoring function $w_{el}f_{el}+(1-w_{el})f_{pr}$ with $w_{el}$ ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. With $w_{el}=0$ the scoring is purely based on priority. At the other extreme ($w_{el}=1$) the scoring is purely based on target elevation. Plots of the quality metrics $Q_{el}$ and $Q_{pr}$ against $w_{el}$ are shown in Figures.~\ref{fig:bdsqel} and \ref{fig:bdsqpr} with accompanying statistics in Tables~\ref{b:f73a} and \ref{b:f73b}. 

The results of HS1 and BDS simulations with a random selection model are plotted for comparison. From Fig.~\ref{fig:bdsqel} it is clear that random selection is always a poorer option. The HS wins over BDS (29.4\% $\pm 4$\%) when $w_{el}$ is small (priority-dominated selection) and only after $w_{el}>0.9$ is BDS better (17.5\% $\pm 3$\%) - this suggests that the HS is quite elevation-dominated. Inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:bdsqpr} shows again that random selection is a poor choice. However we also see that HS beats BDS only when $w_{el}$ exceeds 0.7, suggesting that HS has a lower degree of priority bias. From this we may conclude that HS is using a scoring criterion with a large value of $w_{el}$ and a somewhat lower value of $w_{pr}$ though it is not feasible to determine exactly what these are.

A further series of simulations were performed using BDS with fixed values of $w_{el}$ and $w_{pr}$ to gauge the variation in results. The results for these are shown in Table.~\ref{tab:hsbdscomp}. The column labelled {\bf h1} represents HS1. The various columns labelled $\mathbf{B_a}$ represent the use of BDS with scoring based solely on metric $f_a$. The columns $\mathbf{B_{x,y}}$ represent BDS scored using a combination of $f_{pr}$ and $f_{el}$ in the proportion $(xf_{el}+yf_{pr})/10$. 

The scheduler $B_{el}$ achieves the best results for $Q_{el}$ as might be expected. Interestingly it performs slightly less well than HS on $Q_{rn}$ and $Q_{td}$, and indeed HS performs better on this metric than any BDS implementations including $B_{rn}$. This suggests there may be an element of \emph{urgency-weighting} in HS. $B_{pr}$ performs best on $Q_{pr}$, however, surprisingly slightly less well than HS overall on this metric. HS holds its own against all the BDS implementations on the other quality metrics with the exception of $Q_{td}$ where $B_{td}$ performs twice as well as anything else.

\subsection{Summary and conclusions}
It has been shown that a human scheduler using rules which may not be known to the scheduler himself is capable of generating effective, high-quality schedules as measured by various Q metrics. In some cases the human scheduler was able to outperform an automated (BDS) scheduler on certain metrics. Inspection of the table columns shows the scheduler $B_{8,2}$ comes fairly close to matching the HS column suggesting the relative weightings used are given approximately by $0.8 f_{el} + 0.2 f_{pr}+ \epsilon f_{rn}$ where $\epsilon$ is very small ($\ll 0.1$).
