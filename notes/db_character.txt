I need some way to characterize the content of the ODB - dont want large number of metrics, 
and also dont want metrics which require massive computing/time to calculate 
- i.e. they should be few and simple.

What sort of things characterize an ODB ?

daily and longer period contention/demand profiles 
- these are in fact quite hard to derive but not excessively so.
- can some features be extracted from these profiles 
 - the whole profile is too much information to use as a variable ?
 - this will involve studying daily profiles 
 - i.e. these need generating on new and old collected ODBs 
 - is this even possible for old ?

statistics of groups/observations.
- average execution time of groups in ODB 
 - maybe just looking at groups which are active today or this week/month ?
 - also want to see extremes - i.e. do we have a load of short exec groups
 and a couple of mega exec groups with high priority !
 
target elevations - distribution statistics on sky (alt/az).
- some of these might need weighting by exec times

scientific priorities

accounting info

My guess is that all this information could be collected and munged together somehow !
to produce a general ODB character figure - just how, I have no idea.
